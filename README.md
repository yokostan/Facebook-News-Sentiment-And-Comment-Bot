# Facebook-News-Sentiment-And-Comment-Bot
This is a repo for a bot(tool) used to perform sentiment analysis and comment generation for news posted on Facebook. The project is the final project I completed independently for CS 221 (20 Fall) at Stanford University and is protected with MIT license.

The model was originally trained with data from facebook-news dataset(https://github.com/jbencina/facebook-news), which only contains posts from 83 news organizations and personalities on Facebook and relative comments and reactions from users. The result may work best on posts from the 83 news organizations and personalities from the dataset, but may also perform well if the post is similar to the aforementioned posts or trained again on other posts.
